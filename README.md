This project explores the possible impact of a wide range of factors affecting Indian citizens’ trust
in their national and local governments in India in the context of the country’s upcoming
elections in 2024. Using Wave 5 of the Asian Barometer survey, two analytic approaches were
employed to draw statistical insights: ordered logit and multilevel modeling. Some of its findings
include variations in the factors that are significant to trust in the national government compared
to the local government. The results also reveal state-wise differences, with the northern states of
India being more concerned about economic conditions and safety than southern states in
deciding whether to trust their government. This paper points to the multifaceted nature of trust
in public institutions such as the government, and the importance of maintaining it for good
governance.
